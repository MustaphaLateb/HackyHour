# Hacky Hour, 2016-02-24

## Move meeting to Tuesday
* Starting next week, meet on TUESDAYS 2-4PM
* Need to check with Fred on a room - will send an e-mail letting everyone know where to meet

## Paper on commission test
* Conceptualized paper examining utility of commission test for merging segments
* Run YATSM with and without commission test for a given study area
* Relative comparison of results - Did using the commission test improve the result?
* Discussion of whether better to merge/filter spatially or temporally

## Documentation Review
* Style: Try to use the active voice, not the passive
* Style: You can directly address the reader, e.g. "You can use YATSM to..." rather than "One could..." or "The reader could..."
* Eric - configuration
  * Suggestions:
     * Link sections to other existing sections, e.g link Dataset section to page on Dataset
     * Add examples, e.g. for Dataset, add table with examples of inputs, defaults
* Paulo - classification
   * Paulo is already using links to other sections -- see as example of ref in RST
   * Suggestions:  
     * Add "roadmap", TODO directive, e.g. add ancillary data to classification - links to issue on GitHub
     * Keeping it general - Note that any classifier supported by sckit should be useable (with a bit of work), e.g. YATSM can support "any scikitlearn-compatible estimator"
* Val - exploration
  * Suggestions:  
    * No numbering of sections
    * Link to existing materials for TSTools    

### For next week:
  * Work on making changes, adding to your section as discussed
  * Get your documentation on GitHub in a current version of the YATSM repository


## Discussion about `conda`
* Suggested to download your own rather than use the module on the cluster -- cluster out of date, required extra steps
* When installing packages, use list of multiple packages (rather than install one at a time) to automatically cross-check requirements; Can also create an environments file a la [YATSM conda](https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/blob/master/environment.yaml)
* Periodically use `conda clean` to remove unused packages and tar balls (suggested: do this monthly)


## Code review - KFolds spatial sampling
* Tabled until next week

## Paper on change terminology
* Tabled until we can discuss with Curtis

## Twitter
* Still tabled until we can discuss with Curtis
