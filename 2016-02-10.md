# Hacky Hour, 2016-02-10


## Documentation
* Decided to table until next week since Shixiong not present this meeting  
* Documentation **WILL** be the first thing up next week
### For next week:
  * Have your documentation outlines ready - sections and subsections
  * Push your fork to GitHub so we can view everyone's files

## Update: Eric's ```yatsm monitor``` module
* Residual maps now work with current YATSM results
* Removed MODIS specifics

## Change Terminology
* Not much to report, still need to discuss with Curtis
* Dylan Herina (ENG/KHC undergrad) interested in working on results storage to handle structural breaks and event-based (hierarchical), may develop test case study (gypsy moths in MA?) as part of his work

## Code Literacy - `sampling.ipynb`
* Turn sampling notebook into python package
* How to go from one-application research code to generalizable, reproducible, well-documented, test-covered code?
* Potential lessons: Generalizing code, Sphinx documentation, Travis-CI
### "Homework"
* Check out how K-folds already implemented in [`yatsm.classifiers.diagnostics.SpatialKFolds`](https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/blob/master/yatsm/classifiers/diagnostics.py)
* Check out [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/)
* Check out [Travis-CI pytest](https://travis-ci.org/pytest-dev/pytest)


### TODO
  * Need to create GitHub repository for group (landsat_group?)
  * Potential tools:
    * sampling
    * read raster (our preferred format)
    * write raster (our preferred format)


## Twitter
* Need to discuss with Curtis
* Link in Mark / Mark's class
* @BUEarth_RS - general RS info from BU RS groups
