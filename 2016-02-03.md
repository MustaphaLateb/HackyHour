# Hacky Hour Summary, 2016-02-03

## Data Management News
* Chris and Eric working with Keith Ma on a “data cube” a la Geoscience Australia
* Will be indexing with NetCDF. Check out https://github.com/data-cube/agdc-v2 for more on NetCDF data cube.
* Space saving, eliminate duplicate datasets for different projects
* Using clojure, exclusively functional programming. If interested, check out https://github.com/USGS-EROS/lcmap-data-clj.

## Code Literacy (Ongoing)
* Reviewed general structure of ```yatsm pixel.py``` — seemed to be a very helpful/useful exercise
* For more on ```click```: http://click.pocoo.org/5/
* For more on ```args``` vs ```*kwargs```: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3394835/args-and-kwargs
* Ideas for other code to review? More YATSM? Lasso? Random Forest?

## Documentation (Ongoing)
* Didn’t get to this today — will be first topic next week!

### For next week:
* Please come prepared with section/sub-sections headers for your documentation
* We will review general structure as a group before everyone starts adding detailed content

## Terminology of change
* Still an ongoing discussion, looking for examples of events vs. structural breaks
* A few papers that may be of interest:
  * Ghazoul, J., Burivalova, Z., Garcia-Ulloa, J., & King, L. A. (2015). Conceptualizing Forest Degradation. Trends in Ecology & Evolution,​ ​30(10), 622–632.
  * Peterson, G., Allen, C. R., & Holling, C. S. (1998). Ecological Resilience, Biodiversity, and Scale. Ecosystems, 1(1), 6–18.
  * Holling, C. S. (1973). Resilience and stability of ecological systems. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics.

## YATSM News
* Bug fix: https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/issues/79

## Lab Twitter
* Definite interest among lab members
* Examples of others lab/group accounts: [UBC Remote Sensing](https://twitter.com/irss_ubc), [Fulweiler lab at BU](https://twitter.com/fulweilerlab), [BU Biogeosciences](https://twitter.com/bubiogeo)
* Need to follow up with Curtis!


## Fun stuff!
* Funny animated video - On the importance of data accessibility and reproducibility: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4
