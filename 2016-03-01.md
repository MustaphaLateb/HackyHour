# Hacky Hour, 2016-03-01

## PSA: Merging time series output maps
* Best to clip to WRS2 scene shapefile boundaries BEFORE merging to reduce artifacts at scene overlap
* When merging single date images for same path, be careful with different no data values - bands = -9999, fmask = 255
* Also, be aware of issues with `gdalwarp` and `gdal_translate` -- specify extent to ensure pixel locations aren't shifted and pixel size isn't altered. There is a note on this in Chris's [open-geo-tutorial](https://github.com/ceholden/open-geo-tutorial)

## `yatsm` Documentation
* Most people have committed their updates to fork of `yatsm` on GitHub - great!
* Ongoing process - work on your copy ("bite-sized bits"), commit to your fork when you have a notable change or update, then do a pull request when you want merged into master
* Chris demo'ed how to build documentation with Sphinx - lets us see how our RST formatting is going
