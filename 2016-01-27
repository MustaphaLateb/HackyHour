# Hacky Hour Summary​,​ 2016-01-27

## Code Review - Eric
* Eric presented his Near-Real-Time (NRT) monitoring extension for YATSM, yatsm monitor
* Focus was on clarifying intent of algorithm
* Eric is going to “re-base” the code to work on top of current additions to YATSM
* Consider whether ```yatsm monitor``` will be a combination of modifying results and mapping normalized residuals, or should these be separated, e.g. might want to map residuals for older images, not just new additions
* Eric & Chris will work on this offline, will present again when ready


## Code Literacy (ongoing)
* Decision to review ```YATSM pixel.py``` in an effort to improve our code literacy

### For next week:
* Please go to the ```pixel.py code``` on GitHub and do your best to “read” and understand the code, including calls to other functions
* Come prepared with any that questions Google couldn’t answer
* Also think about modifications/extensions AND how they would be factored into the code


## Documentation (ongoing)
* Contributions guide now available
* Went over how to build documentation - Useful for previewing
* Check out [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) on best practices for beautiful intelligible code by Raymond Hettinger on YouTube

### For next week:
* Bring an outline of sections for your documentation
* Attempt to build documentation as per Chris’s overview


## GitHub News
* Started a shell script repository on GitHub
* Include examples of shell scripts being run by members of the group - informal, jumping-off points
* Contributions welcome!


## YATSM News
* YATSM documentation URL was updated. New link here.
* YATSM now has ~80% test coverage!


## Discussion: Terminology paper
* Discussion of terminology used to describe change detection - structural break vs. event
* Provide specific examples - Gypsy moths? Wetlands?
* Possible extensions beyond Landsat - e.g. “event” could describe cholophyll bloom in MERIS time series
* Potential for a collaborative paper with others doing time series analysis?
