# Hacky Hour, 2016-01-20

## Discussion of environments and requirements
* Photos of the diagram we worked on are included below for future reference

* Note on modules: We discovered today that modules must be loaded BEFORE activating a virtual environment -- otherwise you may encounter Python path-related issues. So load modules, then source your environment for best results :)

## Code review - ongoing
* Decided to table the integrating results reader review/integration for the time being--need to restructure some of the TSTools code to make integration easier, Chris started this work during the meeting
* Next meeting: Review Eric's near-real-time code, move towards integrating that into YATSM


## Documentation review - ongoing
* We assigned the following documentation topics:
  * Paulo - classification
  * Eric - model_specification
  * Shixiong - dataset
  * Val - exploration
  * Xiaojing - near-real time algorithm documentation
### Next meeting:
      * Everyone should come prepared with a rough outline of their documentation
      * Ideally, try to do this using Restructured Text, but totally fine to start in Markdown if that's more comfortable.
      * Don't try and write everything in one shot! Just section/sub-section headers would make a good starting point for review and discussion--this will be an iterative process!

## Lab Twitter
* Group was generally in favor of a lab Twitter account, modeled after UBC Integrated Remote Sensing Studio account
* Proposed name: @BUEarth_RS (since the department is @BUEarth)
* Keep it general -- could link in other remote sensing groups at BU, like Mark's group
C* heck in with Curtis before moving forward
* If it's a go, Val will set up account and corresponding e-mail, share info with group


## New topic: "Code Reading 101"
* Goal: Improve our ability to read and interpret Python code
* Proposed activity: Review a manageable-sized piece of code individually before meeting, start with scikitlearn's Random Forest implementation OR lasso?
* Chris leads walk-through of code during the meeting
* Could extend this to other code examples
* Next meeting: Formalize details, start on this topic the following week (2/3)
